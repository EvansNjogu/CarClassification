# Image Classification (Classifying Images of Cars)
 This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) implemented in PyTorch to classify images of cars. The model was trained on the Stanford Cars dataset, achieving a validation accuracy of 0.7121, which is higher than the training accuracy of 0.6052. The notebook includes sections for data loading and preprocessing, model creation and training, and evaluation on the test set. The notebook can be further fine-tuned for better results.
